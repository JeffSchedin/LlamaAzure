Samples using LlamaIndex with Azure Open AI 

I found that not a lot of things have a very good sample for Azure OpenAI, so I am dropping some snippets and samples here to help those Azureites.

Please refer to the main LlamaIndex documentation for additional help: 

Documentation: https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/.

1. Llama_AzureOpenAI_Vector_Sample:  Shows how to properly set the service context so Llama is aware of Azure Open AI and its Embeddings.
